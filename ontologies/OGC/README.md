# Context
Various ontologies have been generated by INSIDE research pole especially during OGC ELFIE & SELFIE and also in close connexion with the corresponding OGC SWG and OGC-NA (Naming Authority)
Those are maintained in the the relevant GitHubs.

# Hydrogeology
Based on  [OGC:16-032r2 - 'OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundWaterML 2 (GWML2) – International Standard'](http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/gwml/2.2), a 'minimal' ontology is available here : https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoSciML/tree/master/ontology/minimal

# Surface water 
Based on [OGC 14-111r6 'OGC® WaterML 2: Part 3 - Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) - Conceptual Model'](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html), the ontology is available here : https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/tree/master/ontology

# Geology
Based on [OGC 16-008 'Geoscience Markup Language (GeoSciML)'](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/16-008/16-008.html) the ontology is available here: https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoSciML/tree/master/ontology

# Observation 
Two main exercise stemming from OGC/ISO 19156 Observations & Measurements (O&M) V2 already exist.
Namely
- W3C SSN/SOSA
- om-lite/sam-lite

O&M is currently (2019-2020) being updated in a V3, INSIDE research pole is involved in that endeavour.
Based on that upcoming revision, an exercice to enrich the 'pre-existing' O&M ontologies will be conducted.
