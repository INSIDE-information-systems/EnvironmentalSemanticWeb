# EnvironmentalSemanticWeb

## Intro

Test and support to implementation of semantic web technologies in French environmental information systems (French Biodiversity Office, BRGM, IFREMER, MNHN, French Water Information System, ...).

Better interlinkage between them and also with international ones.

## OGC Interoperability experiments

### ELFIE (Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment) 

Running over 2018-2019, the OGC ELFIE was intended to test existing OGC and W3C standards with the goal of establishing a best practice for exposing links between and among environmental domain and sampling features in a highly adoptible standards compliant way that is compatible with modern web search technology.

INSIDE pushed the following use cases in ELFIE

- [Surface-Ground Water Networks Interaction](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/demo/surface_groundwater_network_interaction)
- [Ground Water Monitoring](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ELFIE/demo/groundwater_monitoring)

### SELFIE (Second ELFIE)

Rangin from 2019 to 2020 and building on the content-focused outcomes of the first ELFIE, the Second ELFIE (SELFIE) is designing and vetting Web-resource model and network behavior for cross-domain linked feature data that compliments and uses WFS3 as a building block. This aims to answer the question, how do we use linked data in a way that's compatible with W3C best practices and leverages OGC standards? 

SELFIE outcomes will enrich the initial ELFIE outcomes webpage.

## Linked data

### Demos

First tests on French surface water quality observation database.
Data is linked to MNHN and IFREMER and external resources (CSIRO, qudt, ChemId+, ...)
Some quick link below to dive in the demos (see ['demo'](https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/EnvironmentalSemanticWeb/tree/master/demos) folder).

For more info on how BLiV works and its code, see <https://github.com/BRGM/BLiv> 

### Linked data registries comparison

A comparison of the two main existing tools in Europe has been carried out.
It's shared in the ['linkeddataregistries' folder]( https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/EnvironmentalSemanticWeb/tree/master/linkeddataregistries)
